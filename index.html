            <h2>Why Cape Verde?</h2>
            <h3>History of the Islands</h3>
            <p>
              Cape Verde, an archipelago off the west coast of Africa, has a
              rich history shaped by its strategic location in the Atlantic.
              Uninhabited until Portuguese explorers arrived in 1456, the
              islands became a hub for the transatlantic slave trade, blending
              African and European cultures to create a unique Creole identity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite its wealth during the trade era, Cape Verde suffered from
              pirate raids, colonial neglect, and devastating famines caused by
              frequent droughts. This history of resilience and cultural fusion
              is reflected in its vibrant music, language, and traditions.

                  Cape Fruit is a small but absolutely charming caf√© that
                  focuses on healthy living and healthy eating. It is one of the
                  few places that cater to vegetarians and vegans, offering

                  I love Cape Fruit because of its incredible freshness and
